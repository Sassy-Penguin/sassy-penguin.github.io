<h1>About me</h1>
    <p>'Sup. My name's Ronalyn Domingo.</p>
    <p>I'm 15 years old and in the 10<sup>th</sup> grade. I'm an introverted potato and fequently listen to vocaloid music. I have a lot of favorite songs, like Lost One's Weeping and Honey I'm Home. Since I have essentially no life, I play video games almost 24/7. My favorite games are Overwatch, Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Fire Emblem Three Houses.</p>
    <p>I have no prior knowledge on coding and I've watched a few animes, like Fairy Tail and Seven Deadly Sins.</p>

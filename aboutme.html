    <p>'Sup. My name's Ronalyn and I have no prior knowledge on coding.</p>
    <p>I'm 15 years old and in the 10<sup>th</sup> grade. I'm an introverted potato and fequently listen to vocaloid music. I have a lot of favorite songs, like Lost One's Weeping and Honey I'm Home. Since I have essentially no life, I play video games almost 24/7. My favorite games are Overwatch, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Pokemon.</p>
    <p>Since I don't know what else to say, here's a picure of a nice animal.</p>

    <p>No, but in all seriousness, I'm just an average, reserved student with little goals in life. I don't know what the future has in store for me but I'll handle whatever life throws at me. I'm fairly good at math, though.</p>
    <p>Also, I'm a console player. If you were wondering: on Overwatch, I'm a tank/healer main and on SSBU, I'm a Lucina main.</p>
    <p>Update: I have not changed in the slightest.</p>

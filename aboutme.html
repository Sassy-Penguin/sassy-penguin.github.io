        <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>'Sup. My name's blah blah and I have no prior knowledge on coding.</p>
    <p>I'm 15 years old and in the 10<sup>th</sup> grade. I'm an introverted potato and fequently listen to vocaloid music. I have a lot of favorite songs, like Lost One's Weeping and Honey I'm Home. Since I have essentially no life, I play video games almost 24/7. My favorite games are Overwatch, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Pokemon.</p>
    <p>Since I don't know what else to say, here's a picure of a nice animal.</p>

    <p>No, but in all seriousness, I'm just an average student with little goals in life. I don't know what the future has in store for me but I'm the type of person to go with the flow and let life take me on its own course. I'm fairly good at math, though.</p>
    <p>Also, I'm a console pleb. Console master race. And if you were wondering: on Overwatch, I'm a tank/healer main and on SSBU, I'm a Lucina main.</p>
